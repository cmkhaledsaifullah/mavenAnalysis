Total number of class after filtering: 406090
Total number of methods before filtering: 4691591
Total number of methods after filtering: 4083483



Step2:

Total number of classes in our Dataset: 406090
Total number of duplicate classes having different package: 177088
Total number of discreate classes in our dataset: 51229
Percentage of duplicate classes in our dataset: 43.61%


Step3:

Number of discreate methods: 973303
Method having 1 classes occure in the dataset: 583853(59.99%)
Method having 2 classes occure in the dataset:  251735(25.86%)
Method having 3 classes occure in the dataset:  74667(7.67%)
Method having 4 classes occure in the dataset:  32574(3.34%)
Method having 5 classes occure in the dataset:  8404(0.86%)
Method having 6 classes occure in the dataset:  7962(0.81%)
Method having 7 classes occure in the dataset:  4073(0.41%)
Method having 8 classes occure in the dataset:  3161(0.32%)
Method having 9 classes occure in the dataset:  1109(0.11%)
Method having 10 classes occure in the dataset:  777(0.08%)
Method having 10+ classes occure in the dataset:  4988(0.51%)




Step4:
Filtering the class dataset that has more than 5 candidate(package name):

Total number of Classes in our Dataset: 51229
Number of class that belongs to 2 number of packages: 32230 (62.91%)
Number of class that belongs to 3 number of packages: 9088 (17.74%)
Number of class that belongs to 4 number of packages: 3840 (7.5%)
Number of class that belongs to 6-10 number of packages: 2950 (5.76%)
Number of class that belongs to more tham 10 number of packages: 1481 (2.89%)


Step5:
Filtering the packages by number of class more than 5:

Number of discreate package: 29104
Number of packages that has 1 number of class : 18991 (65.25%)
Number of packages that has 2 number of class : 4750 (16.32%)
Number of packages that has 3 number of class : 2038 (7.01%)
Number of packages that has 4 number of class : 1066 (3.66%)
Number of packages that has 5 to 10 number of class : 1165 (4.01%)
Number of packages that has more than 10 number of class : 561 (1.93%)

Step6:
Filtering the class dataset after step 5
 
Total number of Classes in our Dataset: 4431
Number of class that belongs to 2 number of packages: 467 (10.54%)
Number of class that belongs to 3 number of packages: 415 (9.36%)
Number of class that belongs to 4 number of packages: 336 (7.58%)
Number of class that belongs to 6-10 number of packages: 998 (22.52%)
Number of class that belongs to more tham 10 number of packages: 389 (8.78%)


Step7:
Writting final package and method dataset after step 6

Number of discreate package: 1696
Number of packages that has 1 number of class : 48 (2.83%)
Number of packages that has 2 number of class : 126 (7.43%)
Number of packages that has 3 number of class : 137 (8.08%)
Number of packages that has 4 number of class : 191 (11.26%)
Number of packages that has 5 to 10 number of class : 700 (41.27%)
Number of packages that has more than 10 number of class : 323 (19.04%)

Step8:

Number of discreate methods: 96470
Method having 1 classes occure in the dataset: 65497(67.89%)
Method having 2 classes occure in the dataset:  11987(12.43%)
Method having 3 classes occure in the dataset:  5788(5.60%)
Method having 4 classes occure in the dataset:  4169(4.32%)
Method having 5 classes occure in the dataset:  1839(1.91%)
Method having 6 classes occure in the dataset:  1927(1.99%)
Method having 7 classes occure in the dataset:  2585(2.67%)
Method having 8 classes occure in the dataset:  531(0.55%)
Method having 9 classes occure in the dataset:  487(0.50)
Method having 10 classes occure in the dataset:  374(0.39%)
Method having More than 10 classes in the dataset:  1286(1.33%)
